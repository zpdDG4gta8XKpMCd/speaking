# Pronunciation trainer for English learners

This tool is for practicing English pronounciation.

Here is how it works:
1. find a youtube video with some speech you want to practice
2. play it, hear it, break it down, and remember it
3. speak it out loud recording your voice
4. listen to what you said and compare it to the original
5. find your mistakes, improve, and repeat
