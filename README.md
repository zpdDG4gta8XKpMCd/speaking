# Hearing/speaking/comparing tool for English learners

This tool is for practicing English pronounciation.

Here is how it works:
1. you find a youtube video with some speech you want to practice
2. then you play it, hear it, and break it down and remember it
3. then you speak it out loud recording your voice
4. then you listen to what you said and compare it to the original
