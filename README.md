# Hearing/speaking/comparing tool for English learners

This tool is for practicing English pronounciation.

Here is how it works:
1. you find a youtube video with some speech you want to practice
2. then you play and hear it
3. then you try to speak it out loud 
4. then you compare what you said to the original
